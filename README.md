Database Management Project

This database is designed to store information about incident data with a dashboard. This information contains many details, such as timestamps, type of attacks, the machine the attack was initiated on, etc. Using the data within the database, we can make predictions on what types of attacks could happen. This would allow companies to calculate the risk involved when trying to minimize attacks happening to them.
