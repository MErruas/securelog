Database Management Project

Introduction: 

This database is designed to store information about incident data with a dashboard. This information contains many details, such as timestamps, type of attacks, the machine the attack was initiated on, etc. Using the data within the database, we can make predictions on what types of attacks could happen. This would allow companies to calculate the risk involved when trying to minimize attacks happening to them.

The Security Problem: Cyber attacks are becoming more common and sophisticated and companies, organizations, and even individuals are struggling to deal with threats and notice vulnerabilities in their systems.


In 2024, there were significant increases in cyberattacks and their costs.
In Q3 it has been a 75% increase in loses reported by the FBI and a $16 Billion which was a 54% increase from the previous year in 2023.
